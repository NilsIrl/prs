- find better way to see if we own key to decrypt secrets (can_decrypt)

Next feature:
- generate pass to stdout with --stdout
- copy specific property instead of first line
- sync init set branch
- gtk copy client

Ideas:
- annotate commits, to allow easy filtering later on, useful to filter things
  like re-crypt commits if you'd ever want to figure out what time a password
  was last changed at, annotate in ways like: [prs:recrypt]
